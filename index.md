## Welcome to my GitHub Page.

I am a **Ramón y Cajal Research Fellow** funded by the [Spanish Reseach State Agency](http://www.aei.gob.es/) and work at the University of Córdoba (Spain). My research line is focused on unravelling the molecular basis controlling flowering time in chickpea. Understanding how individual genetic variants combine to provide adaptation in specific situations is fundamental to accelerating introgression of new traits into adapted backgrounds. Flowering time is the major domestication trait defining the adaptation of chickpea to different agro-climatic conditions, and therefore it is a major determinant of its productivity. 

Previously, I worked in the research groups of **Dr Juan Gil** (University of Cordoba) as a **Marie Sklodowska-Curie Fellow** funded by the European Comission under the [Horizon2020](https://cordis.europa.eu/project/rcn/221706/factsheet/en) program, and **Dr Lisa J. Rowland** at the Genetic Improvement of Fruits and Vegetables Laboratory (2012-2017), [USDA-ARS](https://www.ars.usda.gov/northeast-area/beltsville-md-barc/beltsville-agricultural-research-center/genetic-improvement-for-fruits-vegetables-laboratory/) (Beltsville, MD, USA). During 2010-2012, I got a postdoctoral position funded by the Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation through the program “Juan de la Cierva”.
  
    
Currently, I am a member of the research team [Mejora Genética Vegetal](https://scholar.google.com/citations?authuser=1&user=jQPGxsAAAAAJ) focused on identification and analysis of differentially expressed genes during plant development and biotic/abiotic stresses. I look for ways to integrate bioinformatics with experimentation. I am an advocate of gene expression studies in compliance with [MIQE](http://clinchem.aaccjnls.org/content/55/4/611) guidelines. I also enjoy working with Big Data sets. I like data, and I like to extract biological value out of data.  
If you are interested in working with me, feel free to contact me. I am always happy to work with motivated and enthusiatic people.  

At the University of Córdoba, I teach an introductory [Course for Data Analysis](https://jdieramon.github.io/CursoAnalisisDatos/cursoR.html){:target="_blank"} using the `R` programming language.  We have already run 5 editions and the course usually gets some very nice reviews and positive feedbacks from our students.
