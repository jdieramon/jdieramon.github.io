## Welcome to my GitHub Page.

I have worked as postdoctoral researcher funded by the Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation through 
the program “Juan de la Cierva” (2010-2012). In 2012, I moved to USA (2012- 2017) to work with **Dr Lisa J. Rowland** at the Genetic Improvement of Fruits and Vegetables Laboratory, [USDA-ARS](https://www.ars.usda.gov/northeast-area/beltsville-md/beltsville-agricultural-research-center/genetic-improvement-for-fruits-vegetables-laboratory/people/lisa-rowland/) (Beltsville, MD, USA). 
  
In January 2017, I moved back to Spain where I currently live. I work in the research group of **Dr Juan Gil** "*Mejora Genética Vegetal*". My research is focused on identification and analysis of differentially expressed genes during plant development and biotic/abiotic stresses. To achieve that goal, I combine transcriptomic approaches with computational analysis.  
  
I look for ways to integrate bioinformatics with experimentation. I am an advocate of gene expression studies in compliance with [MIQE](http://clinchem.aaccjnls.org/content/55/4/611) guidelines. I also enjoy working with big data sets. I like data, and I like to extract biological value out of data. If you are interested in working with me, feel free to contact me. I am always happy to work with motivated and enthusiatic people.
