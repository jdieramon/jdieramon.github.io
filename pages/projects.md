My research is focused on problems in plant genetics and genomics â€“ particularly, I work on the analysis and characterization 
of differential expressed genes, genome-wide analysis, sequencing and annotation - with the ultimate goal to integrate our 
research into breeding programs and develop better crop improvement strategies. 

This is a summary of different projects we are working on. If you want to keep up with everything we are working on, follow me on Twitter.
