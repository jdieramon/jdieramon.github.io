My research is focused on problems in plant genetics and genomics – particularly, I work on genome-wide analysis, sequencing and annotation - with the ultimate goal to integrate our research into breeding programs and develop better crop improvement strategies. 

This is a summary of different projects we are working on.

  * **[Blueberry project](https://jdieramon.github.io/BlueberryProject/)**.

  * **Chickpea project**.

  * **Asparagus project**.
