## Our small blow against the system  
Córdoba, July 2, 2018.

Today, I got a manuscript review invitation. The authors studied a metabolic pathway, which I am very interested in. It's fruit quality-related. The methodolical approach was sound to me as well. The journal was open access and I try to support that philosophy by publishing in those journal or accepting their invitations. So, I almost made my decision when I read that they were expecting my comments within a week.   

For the reasons I have just explained I wanted to review the manuscript. The deadline was not acceptable, though. So, for the first time, I used the great 'small blow against the system' by [Stephen Heard](https://scientistseessquirrel.wordpress.com/2018/03/06/i-refuse-all-review-requests-with-deadlines-3-weeks-heres-why-and-how/). Thus, I sent to them the following:


*Dear Editor,*

*I’d be happy to review this manuscript, but not with a 7-day deadline.  For several reasons, I believe such short deadlines are unreasonable and work to the detriment of science. They foster unhealthy attitudes about the low value of peer review.  They encourage scientists to have unrealistic expectations for the speed of review and publication.  They drive journals to lower quality by competing based on speed rather than on the value added through peer review.* 

*So, I’d be happy to review with a 3-week deadline.  Let me know if that suits you.*

*Sincerely,*

*Jose V. Die*



They got back to me in 2 hours and were supportive wiht the idea that I needed more time.

## PyCon Charlas
Bethesda (MD), May 17, 2018.  

Recientemente he tenido el honor de participar en la selección de las charlas que han formado parte de las PyCon Charlas en la 
[PyCon](https://us.pycon.org/2018/) que acaba de celebrarse en Cleveland (OH). Es la primera vez que en una conferencia PyCon US, 
las presentaciones se hacen en un idioma distinto del inglés. Se trata de una gran iniciativa coordinada por **Mayela Sánchez**, 
**Mario Corchero** y **Naomi Ceder**, y una oportunidad para toda la comunidad pythonista hispanohablante, 
cada vez más numerosa tanto en América Latina como en Europa, de exponerse ante la conferencia Python más grande del mundo... [read more >>](files/2018_05_17.md) .
