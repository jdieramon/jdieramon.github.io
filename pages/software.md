#### CRAN packages    
* [airqualityES](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/airqualityES/index.html){:target="_blank"}.These dataset contains daily quality air measurements in Spain over a period of 18 years (from 2001 to 2018). The measurements refer to several pollutants. These data are openly published by the Government of Spain. The datasets were originally scattered over a number of files and formats. Here, the same information is contained in simple dataframe for convenience of researches, journalists or general public.
  
#### Annotation packages    
 * [GeneHummus](https://github.com/NCBI-Hackathons/GeneHummus){:target="_blank"}. An automated pipeline with high specificity and sensitivity in extracting proteins from the RefSeq database (National Center for Biotechnology Information) based on Protein Domain Organization. The pipeline is convenient if you are interested in plant gene families characterization, or you'd like to perform some downstream analysis such as phylogenetic construction or gene expression profiling, to name a few examples. Also available on [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/geneHummus/index.html){:target="_blank"}  
 
 
* Full genome sequences stored in Biostrings objects. You can install them from Bioconductor. 
  
  * [BSgenome.Carietinum.NCBI.v1](https://bioconductor.org/packages/devel/data/annotation/html/BSgenome.Carietinum.NCBI.v1.html){:target="_blank"}
  * [BSgenome.Aofficinalis.NCBI.V1](https://bioconductor.org/packages/devel/data/annotation/html/BSgenome.Aofficinalis.NCBI.V1.html){:target="_blank"}
